### Event Model

- `name`, `description`, `date`, `time`, `venue`.

- `total_seats` and `available_seats` to manage capacity.

### Ticket Model

## QR Code Generation

QR codes are generated using the `qrcode` library. Each ticket includes details like:

The QR code image is saved in the `qr_codes` directory within the media root.

## Email Notifications

Ticket booking confirmation emails are sent via the `send_mail` function. Emails include:

- Event details (name, date, time, venue).

- Ticket ID and seat number.
